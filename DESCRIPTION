Description: GimmeMyOmics provides specialized tools for analyzing bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq (peak calling, chromatin accessibility analysis). It includes methods for differential expression, gene set enrichment, over-representation analysis for pathway enrichment, network analysis (gene co-expression, pathway graph) and single-cell workflows (clustering, trajectory inference, cell-type annotation). It also provides a set of tools for data visualization (e.g. volcano plots, heatmaps, UMAP plots and violin plots). The package is built on top of popular R packages (e.g. Seurat, DESeq2, clusterProfiler).
